### Playing the Game
Simply run the below command to start the game

`$> ruby game_on.rb`

Follow the prompts on the command line

### Notes
* Tested on Mac OS X El-Capitan
* ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin15]

### Test
* Since this is an interactive game, only basic game scenarios have been tested

### Known Issues
* The way I have implemented the 'final round' where the one player who has a total_score >= 3000 is not playing in the final round is unfair!
